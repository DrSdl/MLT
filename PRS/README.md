## Parsing of Files ##

Parse with [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/). "It is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It provides idiomatic ways of navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree."

Learn about regular [expressions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html). "A regular expression (or RE) specifies a set of strings that matches it. A regex processor translates a regular expression from a given syntax into an internal representation which can be executed and matched against a string representing the text being searched in." If you are new to regular expressions, take a look at the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression).

Work with the [Natural Language Toolkit](http://www.nltk.org/). "It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources such as WordNet, along with a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning, wrappers for industrial-strength NLP libraries"
