## Parsing of Files ##

Parse with [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/). "It is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It provides idiomatic ways of navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree."

Learn about regular [expressions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html). "A regular expression (or RE) specifies a set of strings that matches it. A regex processor translates a regular expression from a given syntax into an internal representation which can be executed and matched against a string representing the text being searched in." If you are new to regular expressions, take a look at the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression).

Work with the [Natural Language Toolkit](http://www.nltk.org/). "It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources such as WordNet, along with a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning, wrappers for industrial-strength NLP libraries". There is also an online version of the [NLTK book](http://www.nltk.org/book/).

[Request](https://github.com/request/request) is designed to be the simplest way possible to make http calls in Python. It supports HTTPS and follows redirects by default.

** The Example logic: **

- Start reading the [parsing an html file basics](https://github.com/DrSdl/MLT/blob/master/PRS/bs_parsing_an_html_file.html).
- Try navigating the [html parse tree](https://github.com/DrSdl/MLT/blob/master/PRS/bs_navigating_the_parse_tree.html).
- Search the [html parse tree](https://github.com/DrSdl/MLT/blob/master/PRS/bs_searching_the_parse_tree.html).
- Search using regex [style](https://github.com/DrSdl/MLT/blob/master/PRS/bs_searching_by_class_and_regexes.html).
- Parsing an html doc and finding a tag's [children](bs_children_tags.html).
- Sample application to [10Ks](https://github.com/DrSdl/MLT/blob/master/PRS/bs_applying_regexes_10ks.html).
- Bags of words [exercise](https://github.com/DrSdl/MLT/blob/master/PRS/bs_Bag_of_Word_Exercises.html).
- Applying readability [measures](https://github.com/DrSdl/MLT/blob/master/PRS/bs_Readability_Exercises.html).
